# CS188 Projects University of California (Berkeley)

## Overview
The Pac-Man projects were developed for CS 188. 
They apply an array of AI techniques to playing Pac-Man. 
However, these projects donâ€™t focus on building AI for video games. 
Instead, they teach foundational AI concepts, such as informed state-space search, probabilistic inference, and reinforcement learning. 
These concepts underly real-world application areas such as natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.
